        <p className='per2'>I was born on July 14th, 2004 in Tampa, FL. Throughout my entire life, I loved playing soccer, video games, and hanging out with friends and family. I started to paly soccer when I was 5 and ever since then I played for a club team every year until last year, I also played for my high school team which made me like high school a lot more. Since I was young i used to always watch my older siblings play video games and when I was old enough I started to play games like FIFA because of my passion for soccer. When I was younger every summer me and my family visited my cousins who made the entire summer so much fun, and when I got older and made my own friends I enjoyed hanging out with them so much. Recently in the past 2 years, I started to develop a passion for coding which led me to do this project.  </p>
