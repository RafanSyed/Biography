      <p className='edu1'>The start of my Education started in Valrico Lake Advantage Academy from 1st grade to 5th grade. During elementary I mostly remember having fun during recess and not having to worry about schoolwork at all, this mostly changed in middle school. Middle School is where I started to have less fun compared to elementary and I mostly remember that most of my time was focused on schoolwork. However, In high school stuff changed with me being less stressed with school work and focusing more on just having a good time in school, which in turn made my grades and test scores better. Now I'm in College and so far it is fun and I'm mostly focused on doing good in college and becoming a software engineer after graduation.
